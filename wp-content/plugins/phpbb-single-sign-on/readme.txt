Requires at least: 2.8.0
Tested up to: 3.4.0

Authenticate in Wordpress and phpBB at the same time

== Description ==

This plugin allows to use the password from a working phpBB installation to log into a Wordpress blog. or on the other side to log into phpBB with the Wordpress user.

The user needs to exists in at least one of the two instllations. if the user doesn't exist in one installation, it will create the user.

With WP2BB, you can now define that your posts are published in a forum, so that your community can add comments directly on them

The username for the administration must be the same on the two installations.
Otherwise you will end having admins that have no privileges on the other part.

This version tries to get the application working with multiple databases.
Please give me feedbacks.

P.S. : WP2BB was created by Alfredo de Hoces (http://www.alfredodehoces.com/)

How to configure ?

there are three ways to configure it.

In the example, the root of the website is "/www/"

= Example 1 =
Blog  : /www/
Forum : /www/forum/

Path to configure:
To PHPBB from Wordpress : forum/
To Wordpress from PHPBB : ../

= Example 2 =
Blog  : /www/blog/
Forum : /www/

Path to configure:
To PHPBB from Wordpress : ../
To Wordpress from PHPBB : blog/

= Example 3 =
Blog  : /www/blog/
Forum : /www/forum/

Path to configure:
To PHPBB from Wordpress : ../forum/
To Wordpress from PHPBB : ../blog/


= Troubleshooting =

If for any reason you removed the "common-orig.php" file and can't get your forum to work again, simply go to phpbb.com and download the complete package corresponding to your version.

in that package get the file named "common.php" and upload it to your server named "common-orig.php"

== Uninstall ==

To uninstall, you have a few steps to make

Go the the Plugin options, revert the "auth mode" to "DB" and not "wpbb"
If it doesn't work go to the ACP in General -> Client communication -> Authentication

Then go to the wordpress control panel and disable the plugin.

The last step is then to go with FTP in the PHPBB folder and rename the file "common.php" to "common.wp.php" and the file "common-orig.php" to "common.php".

Your configurations should be separated again
